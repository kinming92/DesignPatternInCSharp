### Progress
##### Date: 9/21/2021

#### Date: 10/2/2021
- I learned the concept of provided and required interface
- A provided interface is an interface that describes (the services) that instances of a classifier(supplier) offers to their clients
- A required interface is an interface that is defined by the (client of an interaction) that (specifies what a supplier component needs to do) so that the required interface(it) can be used in that interaction.
- I created basic UML diagram in draw.io
